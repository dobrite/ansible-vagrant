	ansible-vagrant
===============

A vagrant module for ansible, that lets you control vagrant VMs from an ansible playbook.

## Overview

Main page on GitHub:

* https://github.com/robparrott/ansible-vagrant

Ansible-vagrant is a module for [ansible](http://ansible.cc) that allows you to create VMs on your local system using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).
This lets you write ansible [playbooks](http://ansible.github.com/playbooks.html) that dynamically create local guests and configure them via the ansible playbook.
This makes testing and development of orchestrated, distributed applications via ansible easy, by letting you run guests on your local system.

Ansible-vagrant should not be confused with [vagrant-ansible](https://github.com/dsander/vagrant-ansible) which allows you to run ansible playbooks on vagrant launched hosts

## Dependencies & Installation

The vagrant module for ansible requires

 * a working [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) install, which will itself
   require [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
 * that the [vagrant-python](https://github.com/todddeluca/python-vagrant) is installed and in your python path

To install, copy (or symlink) the file "vagrant" to your ansible installation, under the "./library" directory.

To run the tests from the repository, cd into "./test" and run. NOTE: you'll
probably want to disable host key checking and ssh-add vagrant's insecure
private key

    ansible-playbook -v -i hosts vagrant-test.yaml

## Getting started with ansible-vagrant

### Command Line Use
(Note that the following example assumes you know something about ansible and its syntax and conventions)

The following is a simple example, and assumes a linux or unix shell prompt.

First create a simple host inventory file for ansible that only includes your local machine:

    echo "127.0.0.1" > hosts

The target machine image is called a "box" under vagrant, and can be managed ahead of time using a vagrant command:

    vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box

or instead the path can be specified when you start the VM itself. We'll start up a standard VM with ansible-vagrant as follows:

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "state=present vm_name=myvm box_name=precise64 box_path=http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"

This command will download and register the image as "precise64," then start up the image and attribute
the name "myvm" to it. If you had left off the "vm_name" argument, the module will set the vm_name to "ansible" for you.

The command is idempotent, so if the instances are currently running (and you haven't removed any auto-generated state files such as "Vagrantfile.json") then this command will not try to start already running instances.

A more "command" equivalent would be:

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "command=up vm_name=myvm box_name=precise64 box_path=http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"

Note: names in vagrant have to be compatible with the ruby syntax used in Vagrantfiles,
so they can't use "-" or "_", and must start with a lowercase letter. *In the future, you can leave
off the "box_path" argument, as vagrant registers and caches the image locally.

Once up, the image can be logged into via the vagrant command:

    vagrant ssh myvm

or more importantly, registered in the ansible inventory and managed via a playbook.

You can get the status of the machine via the command

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "cmd=status vm_name=myvm"

and it's configuration (in particular ssh config values) via the config subcommand

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "cmd=config vm_name=myvm"

Then you can halt the machine when you're done:

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "cmd=halt vm_name=myvm"

and remove it's record:

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "cmd=destroy vm_name=myvm"

This last command will halt and then remove the record if the machine had been running.

Lastly, we can shutdown and clear out all records with the "clear" subcommand:

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "cmd=clear"

Most correctly, we can insist that the state of the instances is "absent":

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "state=absent vm_name=myvm"

### Playbooks

Playbooks allow you to start up instances in vagrant dynamically,
add them to the inventory and then run "plays" on those newly created instances
from a single command.

Note: when playing around with builds using vagrant, it's useful to clear out your Vagrantfile
and VMs before running a playbook. The following is the equivalent of a "make clean" :

    ansible all -i hosts -c local -m vagrant -a "cmd=clear"

(it's kinda fun to watch the VirtualBox manager window, and see the instances shutdown and disappear like good little vms :-> )

Here's an example playbook:

    ---
    #
    # This section fires up a set of instances dynamically using vagrant,
    #  registers it in the inventory under
    #  the group "vagrant_hosts"
    # then logs in and pokes around.
    #
    - hosts:
      - localhost
      connection: local
      gather_facts: False

      vars:
        box_name: precise64
        box_path: http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box
        vm_name: frank

      tasks:
      - name: Fire up a set of vagrant instances to log into
        local_action: vagrant
            state=present
            box_name=${box_name}
            box_path=${box_path}
            vm_name=${vm_name}
            count=3
        register: vagrant

      - name: Remind us about the vagrant private key ...
        action: debug
                msg="Be sure to add the ssh private key for vagrant, here ... '${vagrant.instances[0].key}'."

      - name: Host info ...
       action: debug
                msg='${item.public_ip}${item.port}'
        with_items: ${vagrant.instances}

      - name: Capture that host's contact info into the inventory (the hostname is a unique ID from Vagrant ... )
        action: add_host
                hostname='${item.vagrant_name}'
                ansible_ssh_port='${item.port}'
                ansible_ssh_host='${item.public_ip}'
                groupname=vagrant_hosts
        with_items: ${vagrant.instances}

    #
    # Run on the vagrant_hosts group, checking that we have basic ssh access...
    #
    - hosts:
      - vagrant_hosts
      user: vagrant
      vars:
        vm_name: frank

      gather_facts: True

      tasks:

      - name: Let's see if we can login
        action: command uname -a

      - name: Let's see all the ansible vars about vagrant hosts...
        action: setup

      - name: Generate a ./blah_ansible.vars to check for hostvars
        action: template src=test-vagrant-hostinfo.j2 dest=/tmp/localhost_ansible.vars

    #
    # Shut them down
    #
      - name: Now shut them down ...
        local_action: vagrant
                      state=absent
                      vm_name='${vm_name}'

      - name: Now clear it out ...
        local_action: vagrant
                      cmd=clear


## Methods and Data Structures

Here, let's talk about the data returned by the various commands.

These data structures take into account that there may be multiple named sets of isntances, and multiple instances within each "up invocation"

### UP

The up subcommand

    ansible -m vagrant -a "command=up box_name=precise64 vm_name=fred count=2

asks vagrant to start up two identical instances of the "precise64" box, and name then "fred." When successful produces output of this type:

    {
      "changed": true,
      "instances": [
        {
          "id": "fred0",
          "internal_ip": "192.168.179.253",
          "key": "/Users/username/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key",
          "name": "fred",
          "port": "2200",
          "public_dns_name": "127.0.0.1",
          "public_ip": "127.0.0.1",
          "status": "running",
          "username": "vagrant",
          "vagrant_name": "fred0"
        },
        {
          "id": "fred1",
          "internal_ip": "192.168.179.252",
          "key": "/Users/username/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key",
          "name": "fred",
          "port": "2201",
          "public_dns_name":
          "127.0.0.1",
          "public_ip": "127.0.0.1",
          "status": "running",
          "username": "vagrant",
          "vagrant_name": "fred1"
        }
      ]
    }

### Status

Subcommand invocation

    ansible -m vagrant -a "command=status vm_name=fred"

reports back with a dictionary of vm_names (only one in the case) with an array of status strings:

    {
      "changed": false,
      "status": {
        "fred": [
           "running",
           "running"
         ]
       }
     }

if we don't specify a vm_name, we get the status of all instances:

    {
      "changed": false,
      "status": {
        "ansible": ["running"],
        "fred": ["running", "running"]
      }
    }

### Config

Subcommand invocation for config data is similar ot status, but with much values returned:

    ansible -m vagrant -a "command=config vm_name=fred"

reports back with a dictionary of vm_names (only one in the case) with an array of dicts about the SSH configuration of the hosts:

    {
     "changed": false,
     "config": {
       "fred": [
         {
           "Host": "fred0",
           "HostName": "127.0.0.1",
           "IdentitiesOnly": "yes",
           "IdentityFile": "/Users/username/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key",
           "PasswordAuthentication": "no",
           "Port": "2200",
           "StrictHostKeyChecking": "no",
           "User": "vagrant",
           "UserKnownHostsFile": "/dev/null"
         },
         {
           "Host": "fred1",
           "HostName": "127.0.0.1",
           "IdentitiesOnly": "yes",
           "IdentityFile": "/Users/username/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key",
           "PasswordAuthentication": "no",
           "Port": "2201",
           "StrictHostKeyChecking": "no",
           "User": "vagrant",
           "UserKnownHostsFile": "/dev/null"
         }
       ]
     }
    }

### Halt

When halting an instance, ort set of isntances, as in

    ansible -m vagrant -a "command=halt vm_name=fred"

report back the resulting status

    {
      "changed": true,
      "status": {
        "fred": [
           "poweroff",
           "poweroff"
         ]
       }
    }

### Destroy

### Clear
